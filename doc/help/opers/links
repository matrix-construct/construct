LINKS [[remote] mask]

LINKS shows a list of all servers linked to the host server.

With a mask parameter, LINKS will just show servers matching
that parameter.  With the remote server parameter, LINKS will
request the LINKS data from the remote server, matching the
mask given.

The information provided by the LINKS command can be helpful
for determining the overall shape of the network in addition to
its size.

NOTE: the links command employs an intensive process to generate
it's output, so sparing use is recommended.

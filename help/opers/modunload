MODUNLOAD <module.so> [server.name]

-- Unload a module from the ircd
Use just the module name, the path is not needed.
When a module is unloaded, all commands associated
with it are unloaded as well.

A server name may also be provided to unload a module
from a remote server if you have the modules shared priv 
on that server. Wildcards for server name may also be used 
to unload a module from multiple servers.

- Requires Oper Priv: oper:admin

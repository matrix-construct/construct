-- charybdis-2.1.2

- Fix bug that could cause all hostmangled users to be exempted when a
  single ban exception existed on a channel.
- Tweak \s code a little.
- Add a minor clarification to the SGML docs.
- Avoid truncation in ip_cloaking (by removing components on the other side).
  Note that this may cause channel +bqeI modes set on such very long hosts
  to no longer match.

-- charybdis-2.1.1

- Search the shortest list (user's/channel's) when looking up channel
  memberships.
- Make the SID-collision notice look right under all conditions.
- Move kills from services from +s to +k snomask.
- When no_tilde is present on an auth{} block, check the non-tilde version
  of the user@host against k:lines as well.
- Put full reason in the SQUIT reason when a server is rejected for
  insufficient parameters being passed to a command.
- Don't redirect users to an existing domain, irc.fi.
- Improve communication of servlink-related error messages.

-- charybdis-2.1.0

- Our official website is now http;//www.ircd-charybdis.org/.
- Make RPL_ISUPPORT (005 numeric) modularizable.
- Also do forwarding if the channel limit (+l) is exceeded.
- Don't count opers on service{} servers in /lusers.
- Allow servers to send to @#chan and +#chan.
- Allow +S clients (services) to send to channels and @/+ channels always.
- Allow normal match() on IP address also in /masktrace.
- Add new testmask from ratbox 2.2. Allows matches on nick, ip and gecos
  in addition to user and host, and is fully analogous to masktrace.
  The numeric has changed from 724 to 727 and fields in it have changed.
- Show IP addresses to opers in /whowas.
- Add extb_extgecos extban option ($x:nick!user@host#gecos), from sorcery
  modules.

  from the other channel.
- Allow opers to /who based on realhost.
- Allow opers to /masktrace, /testmask based on realhost.
- Add general::operspy_dont_care_user_info, limits operspy accountability to
  channel-related information.
- Make host mangling more reliable.
- Prevent ban evasion by enabling/disabling host mangling.
- Add EUID, sends real host and services account in the same command as other
  user information.
- Make it possible to send CHGHOST without ENCAP (fixes problems with old
  services).
- Allow service{} servers to manipulate the nick delay table (for "nickserv
  enforcement", aka SVSHOLD).
- Send server notices about connections initiated by remote opers network wide.
- Fix too early truncation of JOIN channel list.
- Make the newconf system available to modules.
- Add /stats s to the hurt module to list active hurts.
- Add general::servicestring, shown in /whois for opered services (+oS).
- Show real host/IP behind dynamic spoof in /whois to the user themselves
  and opers.
- Document option to disable nick delay.
- Improve logging of server connections.
- Clean up handling of hostnames in connect blocks.
- Remove support for resolving ip6.int, people should be using ip6.arpa.
- Unbreak --disable-balloc (useful for debugging with tools like valgrind).
- Make Solaris 10 I/O ports code compile.
- Add WEBIRC module to allow showing the real host/IP of CGI:IRC users.
- Comment out blacklist{} block in example confs, as AHBL requires
  notification before use.
- Fix some bugs relating to the resolver.

-- charybdis-2.0.0

- Replace ADNS with a new smaller resolver from ircu and hybrid.
- Make services shortcuts (/chanserv etc) configurable in ircd.conf.
- Add extban: extensible +bqeI matching via modules. Syntax is
  $<type>[:<data>]. By default no modules are loaded.

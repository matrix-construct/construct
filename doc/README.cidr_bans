Basically what this patch does is allow for users to use cidr masks when
setting bans, exceptions, and invite invex(modes beI respectively).  This
works for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  

I won't go into details of how cidr works here, but to use them, you could
do something like:

/mode #foo +b *!*@10.0.0.0/8 
/mode #foo +e *!*@10.0.10.0/24

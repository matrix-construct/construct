KLINE <user@host> :[reason] [| oper reason]

Adds a KLINE to the kline.conf file which will ban the
specified user from using this server.  The banned
client will receive a message saying he/she is banned
with reason [reason].

If an oper reason is added (the pipe must be specified
to seperate the fields) this will be added into the
kline.conf but will not be shown to the user when they
are given the kline reason.

KLINE <user@ip.ip.ip.ip> :[reason] [| oper reason]
will kline the user at the unresolved ip.
ip.ip.ip.ip can be in CIDR form i.e. 192.168.0.0/24
or 192.168.0.* (which is converted to CIDR form internally)

For a temporary KLINE, length of kline is given in
minutes as the first parameter i.e.
KLINE 10 <user@host> :cool off for 10 minutes

KLINE [duration] <user@host> ON irc.server :[reason] [| oper reason]
will kline the user on irc.server if irc.server accepts
remote klines. irc.server can contain wildcards.

MODLIST [match string] [server.name]

-- List the modules that are currently loaded into the
ircd, along with their address and version.
When a match string is provided, modlist only prints
modules with names matching the match string.

A server name may also be provided to list currently
loaded modules on that server if you have the modules
shared priv on that server. If you're doing modlist
on a remote server, a match string is required, but *
will list all modules.

- Requires Oper Priv: oper:admin

Target Change for Messages
Lee H <lee -at- leeh.co.uk>
---------------------------

If the server you are using uses the target change mechanism, then
restrictions are placed on how many different users you can message in a set
timeframe.

Target change does not apply to channels, ctcp replies or messages to
yourself.

You will have a set number of 'slots', each different client you message
will take up one slot.  A client doing a nick change will not use a new slot,
however a client leaving the network and reconnecting will.  You will
receive 1 new slot roughly every minute.

When all slots are filled, messages to new clients will not be accepted.
Messages to clients already filling a slot will be accepted.  If all slots
are full, you will receive the ERR_TARGCHANGE numeric, number 707 in the
form:
:<server> 707 <yournick> <targetnick> :Targets changing too fast, message dropped

The slots are operated as a FIFO (first in, first out), so the first person
you message will be the first person removed from a slot, even if you are
still talking to this person.

The number of slots in use will be kept through a reconnection, though the
information in those slots will be dropped.  However, you will always
receive one free slot on a reconnection.  Other servers using this mechanism
will also be made aware of details about slots.

Target change can be avoided via the CNOTICE and CPRIVMSG commands, when you 
are opped or voiced in a channel, and you are messaging a client within that 
channel.  See /quote help cnotice and /quote help cprivmsg for more
information.

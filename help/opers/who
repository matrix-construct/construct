The WHO command displays information about a user, 
such as their GECOS information, their user@host, 
whether they are an IRC operator or not, etc.  A

*       -       The user is an IRC operator.
@       -       The user is a channel op in the channel listed
                in the first field.
+       -       The user is voiced in the channel listed.

The next field contains the username@host of the user.  
The final field displays the number of server hops and 
the user's GECOS information.

listings for each user on the channel.

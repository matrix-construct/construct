  Add general::operspy_dont_care_user_info.
  This makes /who mask equivalent to /who !mask for opers
  with the operspy flag, and removes the operspy log/notice
  on /who mask, /masktrace and /scan.
  The necessary privilege (operspy flag) is unchanged.
  Behaviour for the other operspy commands (channel
  related ones) is also unchanged.

  Make the "keep the parent process around" thing work, by opening
  a pipe to the child process. This pipe is on fd 0 in the child
  process. After successful initialization, the child will write
  a byte to this pipe, on fatal errors it will close it without
  writing anything.
  
  Somewhat hackish still but should work.

  findforwards:
  - note truncation of the list (perhaps sending multiple
    notices is better)
  - clarify in a comment that /findforwards on a nonexistent
    channel can be useful
  - sendto_one_notice() requires that the text start with
    a colon

  When we close a local server's link, always include the
  name of the client causing the exit in the reason in the
  SQUIT we send them (replacing them with us). This makes
  sure server notices for stuff like "Not enough arguments
  to server command" are different on the two sides.

  Alright, so, this massive commit does the following:
  - Removes adns
  - Adds a resolver based on the undernet and hybrid one.
  - Tries to clean up a giant mess in the header dependencies (encountered during the above)
  - Makes a check in ./configure be posixly correct
  - Simplifies the auth code and DNS callbacks
  
  Needs testing. Especially under IPv6. I probably fucked something up there. I will test it later.

  Port over ratbox 2.2 /challenge. This is slightly more secure
  (better crypto, longer keys, challenge timeout) and has better
  client scripts.

  separate package, currently available from
  http://respond.ircd-ratbox.org (we should mirror/... this).
